**Attention**

All of the commits are under either "feature" or "fix" branch.

Once you finish one branch(without bugs), merge it to "dev" branch and delete it.

Once we accomplish one iteration, merge "dev" to "master" but keep "dev" as a permanent branch.

Since time is limited, we adopt AGILE mode to enhance the velocity.
