## how to cooperate and develop

**Attention**

All of the commits are under either "feature" or "fix" branch.

To create a new branch:

Take "feature" as an example,

```bash
git checkout feature
git checkout -b feature-add-buttons
do something here
git add .
git commit -m"your commit message"
git pull
git push origin feature-add-buttons
```

Once you finish one branch(without bugs), merge it to "dev" branch and delete it.

Once we accomplish one iteration, merge "dev" to "master" but keep "dev" as a permanent branch.

Since time is limited, we adopt AGILE mode to enhance the velocity.
