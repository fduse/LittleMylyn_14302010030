## entry

It is obvious that `Activator.java` serves as the entry for this plugin project. Besids, it helps control the life circle of the whole plugin.

## biz

The controller under all of the actions is implemented in `biz`, it takes over what you can do with the task entity. Say, as soon as you click on the view, the TaskBiz will respond to it and calls the Dao to manipulate data in database.

## dao

The `TaskDao` is implemented here to provide APIs for the data in database. With the help of `TaskDao`, `TaskBiz` doesn't need to care about how the data is stored or read.

## entity

Here we implemented the virtual model of File and Task as well as the status and type of tasks. Entity provides convenient access for views and it enables views to cover the fundation of `Dao`.

## test

Here are the unit tests for Dao and Util, and Biz.

## util

Util includes the most fundamental actions, e.g, establishing connection with database and so on. Besides, it has something to do with file count, which will seem ugly if implemented in `view`.

## view

View is the essential part in this plugin since it provides interaction with users. It is separated into parts exactly according to the requirement documentation.
